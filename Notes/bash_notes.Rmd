Bash tutorial

pwd = present/printing working directory
ls = list (of files)
-# = a flag (used to specify how a command works), you can stack flags on one dash or use a separate dash for each
man - the manual command, used to give you syntax, etc. information about a command, including itself (ex. man man)
cd = change directory 
  flags (no dash)
    no flag - takes you to your usr directory
    ~ - takes you to your usr directory
    .. - up a folder/directory
    / - root directory
  * cd looks down the file path, this means you cannot specifcy a directory that is above the current one, you must use cd ..
    
  You can also use a single (.). This tells the command to look in the current directory. For ls, .. will list the files/folders in the directory above your current.

press q to quit out of command outputs like man or less
  
  
Absolute and relative paths
An absolute path includes all the directories from the lowest to highest
A relative path just includes the directories from the current directory
  
  
Task:
Create 3 folders: code, data, and figures
command: mkdir - make directory
  you can't use spaces, special characters (except _ and -) or - at the start of the name
  if you are using a command that is targetting a file/folder with a space, use quotes around the file/folder      name

command: mv - move (item/file)

Want to copy a file?
command: cp = copy (item/file)

Delete a file?
command: rm = remove (item/file)
  !!Permanently deletes the target item!!
  Will not ask to confirm action.

Task:
create a data directory and move .csv files into it
mkdir data
mv co2-un-data.csv gapminder_1997.csv gapminder_co2.csv gapminder_data.csv rnd-un-data.csv data
  You can either move each file individually, in one line as shown above or use the wildcard.
    * = wildcard (Everything)
      Ex. *csv (Everything ending with csv)
      mv *csv data
      You can also use the wildcard around something that you want to look for
        Ex. \*ane\* (Everything that has "ane" somewhere within it's name)
        
less - look but don't edit

nano - edit files
